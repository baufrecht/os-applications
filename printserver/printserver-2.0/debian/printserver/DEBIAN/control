Description: Printserver (HP JetDirect emulation)
 HP JetDirect printserver emulation. The printserver can be configured to
 listen on a specific TCP port. Received data is send raw to an attached
 parallel or usb printer.
 .
 To get the device specific string, you may boot the client with the printer
 plugged in and have a look at the path '/dev/usb/lp/'. The string combines the
 hardware name with the corresponding serial.
 Another approach would be to use 'udevadm monitor --environment --udev' and
 look for a tag named ID_SERIAL
 .
 To use classes of the same printer instead (for instance you want to assign
 any HP DeskJet F300 instead of one special printer) you can also insert
 usb-ids. To get them, plainly use lsusb and use the number separated by a
 colon behind "ID" e.G. 0a12:0001
 .
 Additionally the following AS/400 protocols/drivers are supported:
 .
 - IBMPJLDRV
 .
 - HPPJLDRV
 .
 - NETSTNDRV
